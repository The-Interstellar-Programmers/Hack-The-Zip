# Hack-The-Zip Ver 1.0.0
A password cracker for zip files, based on python, using "rockyou.txt" file as a dictionary (Dictionary Attack)<br>
I have only tried 6 digit passwords, you can try for yourselves.<br>
**IMPORTANT**<br>
If you have an low-ram PC and is on windows, *DO NOT* Open the file in built in windows Notepad, or else your pc might crash,<br>
since rockyou.txt contains up to 14 million words and numbers.<br>
