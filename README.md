# Hack-The-Zip Ver 1.0.0
A password cracker for zip files, based on python, using "rockyou.txt" file as a dictionary (Dictionary Attack)<br>
I have only tried 6 digit passwords, you can try for yourselves.<br><br><br>
When you see these two lines of code:<br>
wordlist = r"C:\Users\Username\Desktop\ZipHack\rockyou.txt"<br>
zip_file = r"C:\Users\Username\Desktop\ZipHack\Payment.zip"<br>
For Zip files: Change the zipfile's name, and then type the directory.(MUST BE DIRECT)<br>
For wordlist: Type the directory you put rockyou.txt in. (Must be same with the python file and your ZIP)<br><br><br>

Update:<br><br>
I cannot upload rockyou.txt on github, so here's the link to google drive: 
**IMPORTANT**<br>
If you have an low-ram PC and is on windows, *DO NOT* Open the rockyou.txt in built in windows Notepad, or else your pc might crash,<br>
since rockyou.txt contains up to 14 million words and numbers, you can open it in Notepad++ instead. (Tried Myself)<br>
